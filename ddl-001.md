# Repository

Title: Define Repository Interface at the Application Layer
Date: [Insert Date]
Status: Accepted

## Context

In a Clean Architecture project, repositories are used to abstract data access operations. The decision on where to define the repository interface impacts maintainability, separation of concerns, and flexibility. The options were to define the repository interface at the Domain layer or the Application layer.

## Decision

The repository interface will be defined at the Application Layer.

### Rationale

Application-Specific Needs: Repositories in the application layer can be tailored to specific use cases without adding unnecessary methods to domain-level interfaces.
Reduced Responsibility for Domain Layer: Keeps the domain layer focused solely on the business rules and logic, ensuring it remains lightweight and independent of specific application concerns.
Better Flexibility: Each application can define repositories aligned with its needs, making the architecture more modular and adaptable for evolving application requirements.
Alignment with Use Cases: Repository functionality is often dictated by use cases, which are implemented in the application layer. Placing the repository interface here ensures it is closer to the services that consume it.

### Consequences

Positive: The domain layer remains pure, and repository designs are aligned with application-specific requirements.
Negative: There may be duplication if multiple applications require similar repository interfaces. Discipline is required to avoid misuse of repositories deviating from domain consistency.

### Alternatives Considered

Defining the repository interface in the Domain Layer:
Pros: Consistent with domain rules, reusable for multiple applications.
Cons: Introduces persistence concepts to the domain, increases responsibility for domain layer, may require unnecessary generic interfaces.

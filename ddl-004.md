# Pre-Generated -IDs for Document Creation

Decision:

We have decided to use an up-front pre-generated list of unique IDs when creating documents. These IDs will be allocated at the start of the process and used throughout the document creation workflow.

Rationale:

 - Idempotency: Ensures safe retries without creating duplicate documents in case of failures or network issues.
 - Consistency: Provides a predictable and traceable ID for documents before they are fully created.
 - Concurrency: Supports high-throughput operations by eliminating race conditions when generating IDs.
 - Auditability: Pre-generated IDs improve tracking, logging, and debugging throughout the document lifecycle.

Implementation Approach:

 - Use a database-level sequence to generate the unique IDs.
 - Allocate IDs at the request initiation stage and associate them with corresponding document creation requests.

Consensus:

Team agrees this approach balances operational reliability, performance, and system simplicity.
